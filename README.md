### DuolingoTreeEnhancer stopped working, HELP!

Duolingo is constantly making small changes and tweaks in the website. When it happens there are two options:

1. If you are a developer and can fix the problem yourself, please submit a patch.
2. Otherwise, be patient. I'll work on it as soon as possible.
